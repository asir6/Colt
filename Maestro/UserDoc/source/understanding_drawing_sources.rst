Understanding Drawing Sources
=============================

Drawing Sources represent DWF-based drawing data. Drawing Sources provide full visual styling of the original DWF, but the associated data
lacks any intelligence or viewer interaction elements. As such, the primary purpose of Drawing Sources is to provide a CAD-based contextual
backdrop for your maps.

This section covers the Drawing Source editor.

The Drawing Source editor is very simple, only requiring 2 fields of input.

 * The source DWF file embedded as a resource data file. The marked one is designated for this Drawing Source.
 * The coordinate system of this drawing source.
